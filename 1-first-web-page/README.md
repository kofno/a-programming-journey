# 1. How Do Things Get on the Web?

## Introduction
Her first question was "how do things get on the web"? I explained that the web is a collection of computers that are connected to each other. I told her that the computers are called servers and that they are connected to each other using the internet. I also told her that the servers are connected to each other using a protocol called HTTP.

In this project, I wrote a simple web server and she will create a simple web page. We will then use the web server to serve the web page.
