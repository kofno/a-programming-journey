# A Programming Journey

## Introduction

My daughter asked me how programming works and how it relates to Math. To be honest, I don't have any
idea how to explain it to her. I have been programming for a long time but I really don't know how to
explain it to a teenager.

After a few conversations, I decided to just let her ask me questions, and I would create example programs
to illustrate the concepts and let her play with them.

This repository is a collection of those examples and the conversations we had.
